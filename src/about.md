# About the author & conflicts of interest

I am a graduate of the **P**olkadot **B**lockchain **A**cademy, or [**PBA**](https://polkadot.network/development/blockchain-academy/), which was hosted and paid for by the [Polkadot treasury](https://polkadot.network/ecosystem/treasury/). I have prior experience in writing [Blockchain Node software](https://github.com/KasarLabs/deoxy) for the [Starknet](https://www.starknet.io/) ecosystem.

This book might receive funding from external sources and if that is the case, it will be made explicit. This book does not aim to endorse or condone Polkadot or any other blockchain (such as [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) or [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/)) but where relevant might point out perceived advantages / disadvantages in technology between such networks.

Finally, since this book is written from the perspective of one more familiar with Polkadot and Ethereum, it will naturally touch more on aspects of these networks as compared to others.
