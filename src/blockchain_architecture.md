# Blockchain Architecture

In this sections, we start venturing into the innards of a Blockchain by examining its most basic building blocks. Along the way, you will be learning:

1. [How servers communicate in a Blockchain network.](./p2p.md)
2. [How to model the state of a Blockchain.](./state_machines.md)
3. [What actually _makes up_ a Blockchain.](./blocks_and_chains.md)

By the end of this section, you will have built a mental model of how a Blockchain works and be able to understand how it would respond to different types of inputs.

> We will close off this section with an interactive activity where you get to build your own basic Blockchain!
